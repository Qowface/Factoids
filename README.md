Factoids
========
A documentation and help plugin for Bukkit. Provide predefined facts to your players and stop repeating yourself.

http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/factoids/

Features
--------
* Provide documentation and help to your players in the form of short facts.
* Allow your moderators to send facts to your players to answer questions.
* Broadcast facts to everyone on your server as needed.
* Facts are stored in a MySQL database, but loaded into RAM on server start/reload for efficient retrieval.
* Designed with web access and cross-platform support in mind.

This is still in development, and though functional, is not quite ready for use by the average server admin.

Web App
-------
A simple web app is provided to display your list of facts on your website. It lists all of your facts and allows users to search/filter them in real time.
